# Rock Paper Scissors Image Classifier
## Overview

The Rock Paper Scissors Image Classifier is an AI-powered project that aims to recognize hand gestures in the classic game of Rock, Paper, and Scissors. The project leverages Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), VGG-16, and Inception Network models to achieve real-time recognition of these gestures. The system is deployed on the Heroku platform using a Flask API for easy and accessible usage.

## Key Features

- Real-time recognition of Rock, Paper, and Scissors gestures.
- Utilizes powerful CNN, VGG-16, and Inception Network models for accuracy.
- Deployed on Heroku for easy access through a user-friendly Flask API.

## Dataset

- The dataset contains 2,892 diverse hand images, providing a wide range of poses.
- Images are available for learning and research purposes and are licensed CC By 2.0.
- The dataset includes hands from different races, ages, and genders.

## Project Structure

- `app.py`: The Flask application that powers the API.
- Procfile in this project specifies the commands for running the app on the Heroku platform.
- index.html file is the HTML template for the web interface that allows users to interact with the gesture recognition system.
- requirements.txt file contains a list of Python libraries and their versions required to run the project. You can install these dependencies using `pip install -r requirements.txt`.


## Getting Started

1. Clone this repository.
2. Install the required Python libraries using `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
3. Run the Flask application using `python app.py`.
4. Access the classifier through the web interface or API.
